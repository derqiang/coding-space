00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:03.177
(upbeat bass music)

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.453
Christina Liens.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.963
Good morning, Your Honor.

4
00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:09.796
Good morning, Christina.

5
00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:10.640
Who's this with you?

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.290
This is my son, Haji.

7
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.953
Haji, how are you?

8
00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:15.625
Good.

9
00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:16.458
Come up here.

10
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.133
How old are you, Haji?

11
00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:28.620
Eight.

12
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.660
Eight years old?

13
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.580
Yeah.

14
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.790
You wanna help me out?

15
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.622
Yeah.

16
00:00:32.622 --> 00:00:33.530
I need some help, okay?

17
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.363
Okay.

18
00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:37.230
All right, you have to promise me that you be honest.

19
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.063
Okay.

20
00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:38.896
You promise?

21
00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:39.729
Yes.

22
00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.293
Okay, now, I know it's your mom,

23
00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:43.540
you're gonna help me make a decision.

24
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.900
And you're gonna tell me, either guilty, or not guilty.

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.190
Okay?

26
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.023
Not guilty.

27
00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:49.029
No, no, no, no, no.

28
00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:50.920
(laughter)

29
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.753
You don't know.

30
00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:53.023
I'm gonna show you a video.

31
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.853
Okay?

32
00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:55.850
And then after you look at the video,

33
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.530
you're gonna tell me guilty, or not guilty.

34
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.732
Okay?

35
00:00:58.732 --> 00:00:59.565
Okay.

36
00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:00.398
Okay.

37
00:01:00.398 --> 00:01:01.231
Now, you promise to be honest?

38
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:02.340
Okay.

39
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.340
Say yes.

40
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.280
Yes.

41
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.113
Okay.

42
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.260
So, your mom is charged with going through a red light

43
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.800
on Roger Williams Avenue and Elmwood Avenue.

44
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.703
And we got a video of it, okay?

45
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.650
Okay, the first vehicle was your mom's vehicle.

46
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.720
We're gonna look at it once more.

47
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.550
Okay, now, you can't make a right hand turn here.

48
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.470
The light is red.

49
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.253
And this is your mom vehicle.

50
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.143
And she made a right hand turn.

51
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.230
So, is she guilty, or not guilty?

52
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.341
Not guilty.

53
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:43.560
(laughter)

54
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.329
'cause that's my dad.

55
00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.895
Oh!

56
00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:49.145
(laughter)

57
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.649
Smart boy.

58
00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.271
It's true.

59
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:57.104
Okay.

60
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.973
Come here.

61
00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:01.620
Did you talk to your dad about this, this morning?

62
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.056
Nah, he's in Africa.

63
00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.540
Oh, he's in Africa.

64
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.373
Yeah.

65
00:02:05.373 --> 00:02:06.480
Oh, he's on the lam, huh?

66
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.313
(laughter)

67
00:02:07.313 --> 00:02:09.199
No, he's always there.

68
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.032
Do you know what that means?

69
00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:11.460
On the lam, that means he left.

70
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.293
Yep.

71
00:02:12.293 --> 00:02:13.610
He left part time, right?

72
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.443
Yeah.

73
00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:15.445
He's coming back.

74
00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:16.623
Yeah.

75
00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:19.210
How long is he gonna be there for?

76
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.360
I don't know.

77
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.295
Want me to send Inspector Quinn to get him?

78
00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:23.128
Huh?

79
00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:25.968
Want me to send Inspector Quinn to Africa, to pick him up?

80
00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:26.900
Yes.

81
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.615
Your mom's sayin', "yes, go get him."

82
00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:29.448
Yeah.

83
00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:30.700
(laughter)

84
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.290
What do you want to tell me about this?

85
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.100
That is my fiance in the car,

86
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.120
and he would be here today, if he could,

87
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.383
but like he said, he was deported in June of this year.

88
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.800
And that's this young guy's dad?

89
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.550
Yeah, and my baby.

90
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.301
Do you know if you're having a boy or a girl?

91
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.134
A girl.

92
00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:49.967
You're having a girl.

93
00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:50.820
What're you gonna name her?

94
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.690
Athena.

95
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.070
Athena.

96
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.060
That's a beautiful name.

97
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.560
Thank you.

98
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.150
Well, I'm not gonna hold you responsible

99
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.260
for something that you didn't do.

100
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.640
Even though you're responsible, 'cause the car's

101
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.950
registered to you.

102
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.457
So, we're gonna give you an early baby gift.

103
00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:09.505
Okay, so this is for Athena.

104
00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:10.560
Okay.

105
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.450
With the wish and hope that she's

106
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.395
a healthy, bouncy baby, that brings you joy and happiness.

107
00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.228
Thank you.

108
00:03:17.228 --> 00:03:18.061
Good luck to you.

109
00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:19.060
Thank you.

110
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.340
Thank you for helping me out.

111
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.173
You're welcome.

112
00:03:21.173 --> 00:03:23.217
That was a good answer this young guy gave.

113
00:03:23.217 --> 00:03:24.410
"My mom is not guilty,

114
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.997
because it was my dad driving the car."

115
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:28.900
Okay.

116
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.300
You can go back to your mom.

117
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.790
