# ES 使用日积月累

## Reindex

> About the reindex process in the Elasticsearch
> Elasticsearch provides an ability to reindex your data, which involves copying data from one index to another. There are several common use cases for reindexing in Elasticsearch, including:
> · Upgrading Elasticsearch
> When Elasticsearch upgrades, reindexing your data is often necessary to ensure compatibility with the new version of Elasticsearch. This is because new features may require index mapping or data structure changes.
> · Changing the index settings or mapping
> If you need to change the settings or the mapping of an existing index, you can create a new index with the updated settings or mapping and reindex the data into it.
> · Combining multiple indices
> If you have multiple indices that contain similar data, you may want to combine them into a single index. You can create a new index and reindex the existing indices’ data into the new one.
> · Removing unused fields
> Over time, an index may accumulate unused fields that are no longer needed. Reindexing allows you to remove these fields and optimize the index.
> · Migrating data to a different cluster
> If you need to move your data to a different Elasticsearch cluster you can reindex your data into the new cluster.
> · Fixing data issues
> Reindexing can also be useful for fixing data issues, such as removing duplicates or correcting errors in the data.
